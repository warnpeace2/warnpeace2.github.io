      <div class="intro-text">
        Abiotic Factor's premise hinges on the idea that instead of being a battle-hardened soldier with experience in hazardous
        environments, you are in the position of an average worker, a standard scientist beginning their first day at the GATE
        Cascade research facility, the main setting of the game. And much like a scientist, the gameplay of Abiotic Factor encourages one main philosophies while playing, and it's
        brains over brawn. The game encourages these philosophy in more subtle ways as you play
        through the game, and to explore these subtleties, we must look at one of the central mechanics of Abiotic Factor,
        portal worlds.

      <h2 class="section-title">Portal Worlds</h2>

          What are portal worlds? They are unique environments that take place outside of the facility itself. They come in a
          variety of locations, some being other locations on Earth, but many take place in alternate dimensions dubbed
          "Anteverses." Ultimately, they all function the same mechanically. Every three in-game days, all of the enemies and
          resources found within the environment will reset, allowing for a practically endless supply of most materials in the
          game as long as you keep visiting them after the periodic reset.

      <div class="wide-text">
        Within the first few hours of the game, you will eventually stumble upon the first couple of portal worlds in the game,
        but the first instances of being able to use brains over brute force can be found in the game's second portal world,
        Flathill. On your first visit to this foggy town, you will have to navigate on foot to various buildings, collecting
        power cells to open up portals to access previously blocked off areas of the town. However, when getting the last power
        cell, you'll have to not only navigate past multiple large, invulnerable enemies named composers, but also ascend a
        large tower, requiring a considerable amount of platforming to reach the top.

      <div class="wide-text">
        There are a few ways to mitigate these obstacles; the first is to unlock some caged ladders, which act as a direct
        shortcut without needing to collect power cells to open portals. However, you still have to navigate through the
        skyscraper to reach the exit. This opens up the second solution, Rope plants. Found in a portal world hours later into
        the game, they act as an easy means to ascend and descend massive heights. By placing one of these Rope plants at the
        very top of the tower, you can skip going inside the tower, saving a significant chunk of time.

      <div class="wide-text">
        And there are plenty of instances of this kind of problem-solving in Abiotic Factor, where it drip-feeds tools to
        circumvent. Towards the end of the game, you'll get deployable items that prevent future spawning of certain enemy
        types, among multiple different options for rapid transport, allowing you to cut significant chunks of time off
        traveling to the entrance portals.
