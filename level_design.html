        When most people think about the identity of the survival-crafting genre, they often look towards the titans of the
        genre, such as Minecraft or Terraria. People think of players being dropped into a vast, often endless, open-world
        wilderness, with a plethora of different environments to explore, harboring unique resources to craft better equipment.
        While it's proven to be a successful strategy, many have vocalized for over a decade about how the concept has become
        overdone, and how many of these games seem to bleed together as they try to copy the formula. In a PC Gamer article from
        2015, Tyler Wilde argues that "...this constant stream of glitchy Early Access ‘me too’ games feels like a lot of wasted
        talent. There are so many clones to sift through that I've lost faith in the whole genre."

          Abiotic Factor deviates from this formula by opting to have a static, pre-designed environment. This alone isn't too out
          of the ordinary for survival games; notable titles such as The Forest and Grounded have implemented a similar level
          design philosophy in their games. However, Abiotic Factor takes advantage of having a handmade environment and manages
          to be even more unconventional in its genre through the implementation of a de facto hub area through the game's very
          first zone, the Office Sector.

        Essentially, as you progress through the story, you visit more and more of the facility's sectors. Most of them are
        designed to be reached linearly, each having a path to an immediate past or future sector relative in the story.
        However, every single sector in the game can ultimately have a shortcut that leads straight back to the Office Sector,
        making travel significantly easier. This level design trope has drawn numerous comparisons to the Dark Souls series of
        games, where players can unlock previously locked shortcuts, sometimes several dozen hours into the game, back to the
        hub area of the game.

        Both games end up achieving the same effect, making their worlds feel cohesive and helping the player immerse themselves
        in their respective settings. By having all sectors of the facility lead back to a single area it makes the facility
        feel like a tangible location with actual thought in its layout.
